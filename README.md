# hello-world
My Introduction to creating a new repository.
The name's Ayce and I've video games for as long as I can remember,
but now I'd like to break away from those chains and elevate my mind so that I could better myself
and become a better version of my self tha i've always imagined. Since early highschool I've always been
interested in programming and the places you could reach with it, it feels almost limitless with the right
aptitude. Now I want to devote myself to programming and become amazing with it so that I can make what I imagine
tangible and something everyone can enjoy. With the right discipline I can make this a reality.
